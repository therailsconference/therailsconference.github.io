My name is Travis and I am organizing a conference around the convergence of the Ruby on Rails web development framework and business in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I want to document the process so that others can use the information to organize their own conferences. Check out the interviews I have done with conference organizers and my weekly updates to get an in depth view of the work.
