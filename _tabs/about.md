My name is Travis and I am organizing a conference around building with the Ruby on Rails web development framework. The conference will take place in Albuquerque, New Mexico in June of 2026. I want to document the process so that others can use the information to organize their own conferences. Check out the interviews I have done with conference organizers and my weekly updates to get an in depth view of the work.
